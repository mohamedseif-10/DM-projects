# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for **data preprocessing** and implementing a **Logistic Regression Classifier** to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the company) based on their attributes and behaviors. The workflow spans from preprocessing raw data to evaluating the performance of the classifier.

## Features

### Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values using **KNN Imputer** for numerical and categorical columns.
  - Dropped duplicate rows to ensure dataset consistency.
  - Transformed categorical variables into binary (0/1) representations.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Derived new features and standardized numerical ones for uniformity.
  - Converted `TotalCharges` from an object to a numeric type.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**:
  - Applied **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to balance the dataset.

### Logistic Regression Model
- **Model Training**: Logistic regression is implemented as the primary algorithm for classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the classifier.
  - **Precision**: Fraction of relevant instances among retrieved instances.
  - **Recall**: Ability of the model to identify all relevant instances.
  - **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusted parameters like regularization strength to optimize performance.

### Visualizations
- **Data Insights**: Plots for understanding feature distributions, correlations, and class imbalances.
- **Evaluation Insights**: Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, and ROC curve to visualize model performance.

## Dataset Description

### Initial Data Overview
- **Number of Entries**: 7,043
- **Number of Features**: 19
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (binary: Yes/No)
- **Challenges**:
  - Missing values in `SeniorCitizen` (20 missing values) and `TotalCharges` (10 missing values).
  - `TotalCharges` stored as an object instead of a numerical type.
  - Imbalanced class distribution in `Churn`.

|---------------------|---------|---------|
| **0**              |  1119   |   433   |
| **1**              |   101   |  1446   |

- **True Negatives (0,0): 1119**
- **False Positives (0,1): 433**
- **False Negatives (1,0): 101**
- **True Positives (1,1): 1446**

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Import
- Load the dataset from a CSV file or database into a pandas DataFrame.
- Display initial insights such as shape, column types, and missing values.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Imputed missing values in `SeniorCitizen` and `TotalCharges` using KNN Imputer.
  - Converted categorical variables like `gender` and `Partner` to binary format.
  - Ensured all features were in the correct data type.
- **Class Balance**:
  - Analyzed the class distribution for `Churn`.
  - Applied SMOTE to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions, feature correlations, and potential outliers.
- Explored relationships between predictors and the target variable.

### 4. Model Training
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Trained a logistic regression model on the training set.
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve predictive performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated performance on the testing set using metrics:
